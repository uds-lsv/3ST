# 3ST

This is the repository to the paper _Exploiting Social Media Content for Self-Supervised Style Transfer_.

## Predictions and Code

Under `predictions` you will find all predictions of the 3ST hablation study. If you only want the predictions of the final 3ST architecture (i.e., with denoising autoencoding, sentence pair extraction and backtranslation), use prediction files starting with `DAE+SPE+BT`.

See https://github.com/ruitedk6/comparableNMT for our code.
